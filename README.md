# Stormy Weather 
Simple Android App to check the current weather

## Description
Get the current weather information of your locality, such as temperatur (in °C), humidity, precipitation chance and a little summary, with this android app. 
I built this app during the Android Course from treehouse. Since the location was hardcoded there, I implemented getting the location of the user all by myself.

## What I learned
- applying the MVC Pattern
- getting data from RESTful APIs (JSON)[DarkSky](https://darksky.net/dev)
- using a DialogFragment to handle missing network connection
- downloading WebContent using the okHttp library
- data binding
- getting current location from user
