# Stormy Weather 
Simple Android App to check the current weather.

## Description
Get the current weather information of your locality, such as temperature (in Â°C), humidity, precipitation chance, and a little summary, with this android app. 
I built this app during the Android Course at Treehouse. Since the location was hardcoded to "Alcatraz Island, CA" there, I implemented getting the location of the user all by myself.
 
## What I learned
-   applying the MVC Pattern
-   getting data from RESTful APIs(JSON) ([DarkSky](https://darksky.net/dev))
-   using a DialogFragment to handle missing network connection
-   downloading WebContent using the [okHttp library](https://square.github.io/okhttp/)
-   data binding
-   getting current location from the user
